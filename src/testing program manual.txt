To test our algorithm, please refer to ExampleApp.java to find more details, 
and write your own test cases if necessary.

After editing the ExampleApp.java, compile the code and
run the ExampleApp using the script 
"unix-compile-run-clean.sh" for UNIX-like system (e.g. OSX, Linux)
or "win-compile-run-clean.bat" for Windows system.

Or you can compile and run them manually with following commands:

javac *.java lab2algo/*.java
java ExampleApp
