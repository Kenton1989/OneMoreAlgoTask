     * Brute force solution for question in lab 2.

     * @param graph A undirected unweighted graph representing the city road network.
     * @param k The number of nearest hospital to be found.
     * @return two array of List of Integer representing the answer.
     * <p>
     *         First one store k nearest hospitals for each node.
     *         Each element of array is a array contains the list of nearest hospital.
     *         That is, arr[N] = list of k hospitals that are the nearest hospital to node N.
     *         For any hospital H, arr[H] can be any format, even a null.
     *         If from a node N, only X hospitals can be reached and X < K, then arr[N] is a list
     *         of size X.
     * <p>
     *         Second one store the distance to k nearest hospitals for each node.
     *         Each element of array is a array contains the list of diatance to a hospital.
     *         That is, arr[N] = list of distance to k hospitals that are the nearest hospital to node N.
     *         For any hospital H, [H] can be any format, even a null.
     *         If from a node N, only X hospitals can be reached and X < K, then arr[N] is a list
