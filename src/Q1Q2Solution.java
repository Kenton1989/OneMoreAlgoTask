     * <p>
     *      The first one is the distance between the node and the nearest hospital.
     *      If a node is hospital, the distance is 0.
     *      If a node cannot reach any hospital, the diatance is -1.
     * <p>
     *      The second one is the node id of the nearest hospital.
     *      If a node is hospital, the nearest hospital is itself.
     *      If a node cannot reach any hospital, put a -1.
     * <p>
     *      The third one is the parent of a node in the BFS tree.
     *      If a node is hospital, its parent is itself.
     *      If a node cannot reach any hospital, put a -1.
